1. Physical Layer
	* Hardware elements like cables, repeaters, hubs
	* Handles transmission of raw data
	* Fiber optics and Wi-Fi operate at this layer

2. Data Link Layer
	* Node-to node data transfer, error detection and correction
	* Manages MAC addresses
	* Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
3. Network
	* Data routing, forwarding, and addressing
	* Determines the best physical path for data based on network conditions, priority of service, etc
	* IP addresses, packet forwarding
	* IP, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
4. Transport
	* Segments and reassembles data for transmission, more error detection
	* TCP and UDP
	* TCP reliable with error checking and three way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)
	* UDP is connectionless, faster, good for stuff like video streaming
5. Session
	* Controls the connections between computers (establish, termination)
	* RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
